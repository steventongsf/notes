# Rename remote branch name
Start by switching to the local branch which you want to rename:

git checkout <old_name>
Rename the local branch by typing:

git branch -m <new_name>
At this point, you have renamed the local branch.

If youâ€™ve already pushed the <old_name> branch to the remote repository, perform the next steps to rename the remote branch.

Push the <new_name> local branch and reset the upstream branch:

git push origin -u <new_name>
Delete the <old_name> remote branch:

git push origin --delete <old_name>
